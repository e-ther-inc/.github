please read the [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Some thoughts to help you contribute to this project

## Recommended Communication Style

1. Always leave screenshots for visuals changes
1. Always leave a detailed description in the Pull Request. Leave nothing ambiguous for the reviewer.
1. Always review your code first. Do this by leaving comments in your coding noting questions, or interesting things for the reviewer.
1. Always communicate. Whether it is in the issue or the pull request, keeping the lines of communication helps everyone around you.

## Setup (forks are preferred).

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/<your-name>/beta.e-ther-inc.com
$ cd beta.e-ther-inc.com
$ npm ci
```

## Building

```shell
$ npm run build
```

## Testing
For running the test suite, use the following command. Since the tests run in watch mode by default, some users may encounter errors about too many files being open. In this case, it may be beneficial to [install watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/docs/install.html).
```sh
# the tests will run in watch mode by default
$ npm run test
```

## Pull Requests

### _We actively welcome your pull requests, however linking your work to an existing issue is preferred._

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
1. Name your branch something that is descriptive to the work you are doing. i.e. adds-new-thing or fixes-mobile
1. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
1. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
1. If you make visual changes, screenshots are required.
1. Ensure the test suite passes.
1. Make sure you address any lint warnings.
1. If you make the existing code better, please let us know in your PR description.
1. A PR description and title are required. The title is required to begin with: "feat:" or "fix:"
1. [Link to an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/autolinked-references-and-urls) in the project. Unsolicited code is welcomed, but an issue is required for announce your intentions. PR's without a linked issue will be marked invalid and closed.

*note for maintainers: All pull requests need a label to assist automation. See the [template](https://github.com/open-sauced/open-sauced/blob/HEAD/.github/release-drafter.yml) to guide which labels to use.*

### PR Validation

Examples for valid PR titles:

- fix: Correct typo.
- feat: Add support for Node 12.
- refactor!: Drop support for Node 6.

_Note that since PR titles only have a single line, you have to use the ! syntax for breaking changes._
